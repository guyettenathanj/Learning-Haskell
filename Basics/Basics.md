Haskell is a pure functional language with lazy evaluation. It is declaritive and uses immutable data types.

# Functional Purity: 
Equivalent to mathematical functions. Take in input, and return a result. They cannot manipulate the global state.

# Lazy evaluation
Only evaluates a function when needed.

# Declaritive Programming
Defines the what of the program more than the how.
